IRCCloud-Highlights
===================

I used [IRCCloud-Logger](https://github.com/blha303/IRCCloud-logger) 

![Windows demo](http://i.imgur.com/QsBU8z0.png)

Instructions
------------

* Get Python 2.7.* and pip.
* Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install colorama.
* Run the script with `python highlights.py <email> <password>'. Don't enclose the password in quotes. If your password contains characters that don't work in a terminal, escape them or put the whole command in quotes.
* Let me know if you'd like this to play a sound on new highlight. I left that out because the main client has sound notifications. (as buggy as it is)
